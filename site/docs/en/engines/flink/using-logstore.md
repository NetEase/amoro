Due to the limitations of traditional offline data warehouse architectures in supporting real-time business needs, real-time data warehousing has experienced rapid evolution in recent years. In the architecture of real-time data warehousing, Apache Kafka is often used as the storage system for real-time data. However, this also brings about the issue of data disconnection between offline data warehouses.

Developers often need to pay attention to data stored in HDFS as well as data in Kafka, which increases the complexity of business development. Therefore, Arctic proposes the addition of an optional parameter, "LogStore enabled" (`log-store.enabled`), to the table configuration. This allows for retrieving data with sub-second and minute-level latency by operating on a single table while ensuring the eventual consistency of data from both sources.
